Please keep the folder structure as is, you'll have to run the model in two steps:

1.  RUN_BMAM.m makes the stimuli and runs the model up until AN. After compilation of trading.so, you can just run this .m file and it should create a NHClicks.mat file in the out folder

2.  then go to the CNIC folder and run the ICwaveratio.m file for the CN and IC model.
