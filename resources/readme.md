This directory contains utility and third-party code that was used during development.
  
  1.  cf-dependence-fitting/ contains curve-fitting analysis to generate a mapping based on 
  Temchin, A. N., Rich, N. C., and Ruggero, M. a (2008). “Threshold Tuning Curves of Chinchilla Auditory Nerve 
  Fibers II Dependence on Spontaneous Activity and Relation to Cochlear Nonlinearity,” 
  J. Neurophysiol., 100, 2899–2906. doi:10.1152/jn.90639.2008
  
  2.  click-in-noise contains the matlab code that generated the human stimuli for  
  Mehraei, G., Hickox, A. E., Bharadwaj, H. M., Goldberg, H., Verhulst, S., Liberman, M. C., and 
  Shinn-Cunningham, B. G. (2016). “Auditory Brainstem Response Latency in Noise as a Marker of Cochlear 
  Synaptopathy,” J. Neurosci., 36, 3755–3764. doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4460-15.2016
  
  3.  zilany-scaling contains a small python function that computes the proper scaling factor to reweight zilany output
  so that it can be directly compared with verhulst output for brainstem models.
