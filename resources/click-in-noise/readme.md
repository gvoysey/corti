Click-in-noise tones
===
The code used to generate the model and human tones used by Mehraei (2015,1016). 


Notice that the 1st condition is the click in quiet and condition 2 are the click in noise. 
I am also attaching the scripts that I used to generate the stimuli for the model simulations: this includes the chirp 
(calls a few functions) and the click train.
